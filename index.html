                <h1>Strategy Games</h1>
                <img class="centre" src=https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.LOdv0U0gsxVoM5ydGrFAeAHaFj&pid=Api&P=0&w=207&h=156>
                <p> This category is usually for the seriuos gamers , I say so as it can really get serious!
                    But truely Startegy games can take longer to play and involve 
                    a more involved planning or startegy in place as the gameplay progresses.
                </p>
                <div class='stuff'>
                    A few of my favourites are the really long running games but the are worth the time!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Terraforming Mars</li>
                        <li>Terra Mystica</li>
                        <li>Power Grid</li>
